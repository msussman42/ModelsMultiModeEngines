1. Aland
University of Dresden

i. Quality of the project and the preliminary work.

The following preliminary articles are of high quality:

D. Mokbel , H. Abels, S. Aland . A phase field model for fluid structure 
interaction. J.  Comp. Phys. 372 (2018)

S. Aland , F. Chen. An efficient and energy stable scheme for a 
phase field model for the moving contact line problem. 
Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids. 81 (2015)

S. Aland, Time integration for diffuse interface models for two-phase 
flow. J. Comp. Phys.  262 (2014)

The project is of very good quality but I have some questions.

question 1: The FSI algorithm has an Eulerian representation for the structure
 (I look at JCP 2018 article)?
 I am worried about whether the numerical solutions share the same 
 elastic structure reversibility properties as what is seen physically?
 If the structure solver used a Lagrangian grid, I would not be worried
 about numerical reversibility properties.

question 2: The 2014 article discusses problems in which there is no merging
 or rupture of interfaces.  I wonder if the advantages of high order
 time integration schemes, in which the time step exceeds the characteristic
 surface tension time scale associated with a given grid size, will be
 lost for problems with droplet/bubble merging and/or rupture?  
 The time scales are very fast near rupture, Taylor series 
 analysis in time will show that the benefits of high order in time
 schemes will not be realized near rupture/merge of interfaces.

question 3: The proposers do not discuss dynamic contact angle/triple point
 conditions? In this project, in which there are flexible and switchable
 surfaces, should not dynamic conditions be studied?  For example, how
 much force does it take to pull a flexible solid out of a liquid
 bath with constant velocity?

question 4: The phase field model requires that an interface thickness
 parameter $\epsilon$ be prescribed.  What is the applicants' strategy
 for prescribing this parameter?

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is highly
qualified to carry out the proposed project.

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The objectives and work program is
good, but I would have liked to see more planned validation tests
for dynamic contact angle/triple point problems.  Only by testing the
dynamic cases can it be determined if the proposers' numerical tools
properly take into account the atomistic scales (either by model, or
some kind of multiscale method).

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

The project will contribute to predicting the motion
of drops on flexible solids in which the proposed algorithms are
accurate at scales of size of microns.  It is assumed that somehow
experimental results and models (experimental or numerical) at the nanoscale
will be merged with the proposed method.

(v) recommendation: very good.

2. Brinkmann
University of Saarbrucken

i. Quality of the project and the preliminary work.

The following preliminary articles are of high quality:

R. de Ruiter, C. Semprebon, M. van Gorcum, M. H. G. Duits, M Brinkmann, and 
F. Mugele, ``Stability limits of capillary bridges: how contact angle
hysteresis affects morphology transitions of liquid microstructures,'' 
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114: 234501 (2015)

C. Semprebon, C. Herrmann, B-Y Liu, R. Seemann, and M. Brinkmann,
``Shape Evolution of Droplets Growing on Linear Microgrooves,'' 
Langmuir 11: 10498-10511 (2018)

The project is of very good quality but I have some questions regarding the
numerics (the proposed condensation, evaporation, and wicking
experiments on patterned surfaces seem
novel and significant to me).

question 1: The long wavelength model assumes that the interface slopes
have relatively small inclines 
(see Mahady, Afkhami, Kondic 2016 - note: both initial film thickness
and resulting droplet heights are on the scale of nm in this article, but
still the LW approximation had to be abandoned).  
Is this condition satisfied for the physical problem in question?

question 2: I see very little description of accompanying numerical algorithms
 for predicting evaporation, condensation, or the interaction between
 a fluid and flexible/switchable structure.  This catches me by surprise
 since in the objectives section it says that the experiments would be 
 accompanied by simulation.  Condensation and Evaporation processes
 are very difficult to simulate due to not only the wide range of scales
 needed to resolve for simulating contact line dynamics, but also 
 the wide range of scales needed to resolve for predicting the rate 
 of mass transfer near the junction where solid, fluid, vapor meet.  
 Details of numerics for this?

question 3: I could not find where it was explicitly mentioned at which
 scales the proposers would focus on? nanometer scale? micron scale? both?
 How would one bridge the nanometer scale to the micron scale?
 In the article by de Ruiter et al (2015), it is mentioned that a drop
 is in contact with a ``millimeter-sized stainless steel sphere \ldots.''
 In the article by Semprebon et al (2018), the grooved surface had a 
 period of about 10 microns and only very slow flows were considered. 
 In both the articles, static equilibrium numerical models, in contrast
 to dynamic capable models, were considered.  

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence that 
the applicant is 
qualified to carry out the proposed project for the experimental part.

As mentioned previously, 2 of the proposers' recent articles implemented
algorithms designed for static or slow moving problems, but in order to
meet the overall objectives of the program, do not the physics of dynamic
contact line/triple point problems need to be met?

(iii) objectives and work program. 
The ojectives and work program for the
experimental part of the proposal are fine, but I could not find enough
detail in the proposal for me to judge the numerics; will the
assumptions of the long wave length model be satisfied for the
contact line dynamic problems tackled by the applicant?

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of
priority program.  

The project will contribute experiments for the
investigation of evaporation, condensation, and wicking 
into arrays of lamella.

(v) recommendation: good.

(Advancing and Receding contact angle for different materials 
impregnated with silicone oil with thickness 2.7 microns? 2.3nm?
~2 mm radius droplets)

The quality of the projects and of the preliminary work is very good:
``A main objective of the proposed research will be to achieve a 
comprehensive understanding of dynamic wetting on LISs. A special 
focus will be on the role of surfactants.'' Also, the proposers discuss the
study of electric-field induced displacement of droplets on liquid
infused surfaces.  

I have two questions:
question 1: In Figures 6-9, I see schematics illustrating 3 fluid materials
along with a triple junction: the droplet, oil (infused layer), and surrounding
fluid.  According to the proposal and also the article by Eifert et al, the
length scale for the droplet is about 1 mm.  According to the article by
Eifert et al, the oil layer thickness is about 3 nm thick? Are the
proposers planning to resolve all the scales from nm to mm?  The required
grid size and time step constraint must be very stringent in order to
properly resolve the balance of viscous and surface tension forces at the
triple point? 

In the article by Mahady, Afkhami, Kondic 2016, they report that both the 
droplet height and film thickness have magnitudes in the 5-100 nm range 
in which they have to use AMR to speed up their simulations.  But for this
proposal, the scales range from nm to mm.  How do the proposers 
intend to address the wider range of scales?

question 2: The level set method is not a volume preserving interface
 tracking method.  The volume errors for two material problems already
 are a problem if one wants to try and compute terminal behavior in
 deforming boundary problems (why the conservative LS method was developed,
 or hybrid LS and VOF methods).  Now, the proposers want to solve problems
 with triple junctions using the LS method.  Why will volume loss over time
 not be a problem?

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The two applicants' publication records
and quality of articles published (articles on numerical and
experimental developments) are evidence that 
the applicants are qualified to carry out the proposed project 

(iii) objectives and work program. 

The objectives and work program are a continuation of the proposers'
previous work which is very good.  There are some issues regarding
how to numerically simulate flows containing a triple point using the
level set method, but the reviewer is optimistic that the proposers will
figure something out given their track record.


(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of
priority program.  

The proposed work on the effect of surfactants and external electric
fields on dynamic contact line dynamics on liquid infused surfaces
address the main aims of the priority program.

(v) recommendation: very good.

4. Kummer
University of Darmstadt

i. Quality of the project and the preliminary work.

The following preliminary articles are of high quality:

F. Kummer, ``Extended discontinuous Galerkin methods for two-phase flows: 
the spatial discretization,'' Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng., 
vol. 109, no. 2, pp. 259–289, 2017.

immersed boundaries Int. J. Numer. Methods

Galerkin methods with moving domains,'' Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng.,

moving body flows using a cut cell discontinuous Galerkin method,''
Computers and Fluids, vol. 153, pp. 118–129, 2017.
(settling particle, oscillating cylinder, rotating cylinder)

The project is of very good quality but I have some questions.

question 1: Saye has written two more articles that the proposer is not
 aware of:
(a) ``Implicit mesh discontinuous Galerkin methods and interfacial
gauge methods for high-order accurate interface dynamics,
with applications to surface tension dynamics, rigid body
fluid–structure interaction, and free surface flow: Part I'' and
(b) ``Implicit mesh discontinuous Galerkin methods and interfacial
gauge methods for high-order accurate interface dynamics,
with applications to surface tension dynamics, rigid body
fluid–structure interaction, and free surface flow: Part II'', which appeared
in JCP, 2017.  
My first question is this: for the problems proposed to be
numerically simulated, what evidence is there in Saye's Part II article
that the high order spectral method will give better accuracy per grid
cell than a low order, sharp interface method?  I ask this question 
since the higher the order, the worse conditioned the matrix solver? 
Wouldn't large density ratio problems or FSI problems exacerbate the problem?
For the DG algorithm, is the matrix system to be inverted symmetric? 
Can MGPCG be used?  Also, 
I look at Figure 6 of the proposal, and
it looks to me that at the points where interfaces first come in contact
with the flexible substrate, the space 
and time grid will always be underresolved.  Wouldn't an underresolved
grid negate any advantage of a high order method?

question 2: The applicant is proposing a DG method with spectral accuracy
 even in mixed elements.  This means that one will have the flexibility
 to specify first, second, third, fourth, or higher order in an element. 
 What is expected to be the optimal order? in space? in time? What about
 in unmixed elements?

question 3: The level set method is not a volume preserving interface
 tracking method.  The volume errors for two material problems already
 are a problem if one wants to try and compute terminal behavior in
 deforming boundary problems (why the conservative LS method was developed,
 or hybrid LS and VOF methods).  Now, the proposers want to solve dynamic
 contact line problems using the LS method.  Why will volume loss over time
 not be a problem?

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published 
are evidence that 
the applicants are qualified to carry 
out the proposed project 

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The objectives and work program for simulating 3 phase systems with a 
flexible substrate is good.

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

The main aims of the priority program will be met, albeit I could not find
serious discussion addressing the wide range of scales that appear in
dynamic contact line or dynamic triple point problems.  Considering the
size and complexity of Saye's papers 1 and 2 (in which contact line dynamics
or triple point dynamics were not considered), I am worried that the 
applicants will not finish in 4 years.  More realistically, this is a
6 year project.

(v) recommendation: Very Good.

contact angle condition? or is flow slow enough or particles small enough 
that static condition is sufficient?)

The project is of good quality but I have some questions.

question 1: The phase field model requires that interface thickness
 parameter(s) $\epsilon$ be prescribed.  What is the applicants' strategy
 for prescribing these parameters?

question 2: Do the applicants intend to simulate dynamics of drops on liquid
 infused surfaces (or drops impacting a flexible substrate) at the nanoscale
 or micron scale or both? i.e., I could not find much discussion on the
 applicants strategy for dynamic contact line or dynamic triple point models.

question 3: What are the details of the FSI algorithm used to simulate the
 problem illustrated in Figure 11 of the proposal?

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is highly
qualified to carry out the proposed project.

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The objectives and work program is good.  There are numerous articles
describing phase field methods for ternary configurations.  It should
not be too difficult to extend from 2 fluids to 3.  I would have liked
to see more details for the strategy to assign values to the
thickness parameter $\epsilon$.  Also I would have liked to see more
information regarding the proposed FSI algorithm.  I was caught by 
surprise because Figure 11 shows a drop impacting a flexible elastic substrate,
but the applicant does not have this item in the list of work programs.

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

The project has 3 parts which are partially relevant to the program:
(a) development of a ternary fluid model.
(b) droplet impact with a fluidic interface
(c) droplet impact with a hard substrate covered by a thin liquid.

I am surprised that in the work plan section, I did not see much information
on the details of a dynamic contact line algorithm, or dynamic triple point
algorithm.

(v) recommendation:  Good.

The project is of good quality but I have some questions.

question 1: How is the applicant going to use the information from
 the lubrication approximation analysis in order to resolve the
 ``contact line singularity'' for a macro-scale model if the apparent
 angle is greater than, say, 90 degrees?  This point was
 not made clear to me in the proposal.  For example, in typical
 dynamic contact line models (at the scale of microns), 
 practitioners prescribe an ``effective'' 
 contact angle (and a slip condition) that depends on the tangential 
 velocity near the wall.  
 (see Figures 28 and 30 of Bonn et al, ``Wetting and Spreading'' (2009),
  or Figure 14 of Cantat, ``Liquid meniscus friction on a wet plate:
  Bubbles, lamellae, and foams'' (2013), or Figure 3 (illustration
  of the wide range of scales) of
  Dupont and Legendre, ``Numerical simulation of static and sliding 
  drop with contact angle hysteresis'' (2010),
  or Figure 7 of ``Sliding of Liquid Drops Down an Inclined Solid Surface''
  (2002)).

question 3: Phase field (diffuse interface)
 models require that an interface thickness
 parameter $\epsilon$ be prescribed.  What is the applicants' strategy
 for prescribing this parameter?

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is 
qualified to carry out the proposed project.

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The applicant correctly points out in the proposal that one cannot possibly
simulate all the appropriate scales (from the nanometer scale to the 
micron scale) with a single monolithic method.  Also, it is agreed that
if one were to develop a single ``monolithic'' method, the method would
not only have to resolve the wide range of spatial scales, but also must
take very small time steps.

What the referee does not see in the work program though, is a viable
strategy for using information derived at the small scales in order
to parameterize an algorithm designed for the ``macro'' scale.

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

The study of the multiscale aspects of dynamic contact angle conditions and
the effect of an electric field address the priority program.  I could not
find a plan for predicting drop motion on a flexible substrate.

(v) recommendation: Good

(algorithm for improving volume preserving characteristics of an SPH method)

It is proposed to simulate contact line dynamics for drops on (flexible)
high aspect ratio microstructures.  The project is original and can be
significant.  Also, the project addresses the main themes of the priority
program.  I have the following questions:

question 1: In previous work by the applicant, the scales addressed were
 on the order of microns and then some kind of model (either implicitly or
 explicitly intended) must have been put into place in order to simulate
 the interaction between the nanoscale and the micron scale.  For this
 proposal, at which scales will computations take place?  Or will the 
 applicant attempt to resolve all the scales from the nanoscale to the 
 micronscale?

question 2: The article by Nair and Tomar (JCP, 2015) improves the 
 volume preservation properties of their SPH algorithm, but does not
 remove the volume error.  Will volume conservation be a problem for 
 the proposed project? (it is not addressed in the proposal)


(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is 
qualified to carry out the proposed project.


(iii) objectives and work program.  

Overall, I really like the objectives and work program.  I have never
seen a nice validated simulation of contact line dynamics on flexible
hairs (flexible pillars) as proposed here.  I would have liked to see 
a better, more realistic, explanation of which scales will be resolved 
and which will be modeled.

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

The project directly addresses the main themes of the priority program.
This is the only project from my batch that addresses the problem
of contact line dynamics on hairs (flexible micropillars)

(v) recommendation:  Outstanding.

(3 height functions, $h_1$, $h_{\ast}$, and $h_2$, opening angle(s) are
small))

It is proposed to further develop the applicants' algorithms for simulating 
moving contact line dynamics.  It is proposed to improve the modeling
of hysteretic behavior, include the effects of surfactant transport, and
include the effects of an elastic/deformable substrate.  Also, in order
to improve the resolution of the contact line, it is proposed to develop
a high order interface-tracking ALE method.  

question 1:
The applicant will be improving algorithms that use the thin-film/long 
wave approximation.   Thin film approximations, while being very efficient,
are only designed for problems with relatively small static angles.  
What if the static angle is near or greater than 90 degrees?

question 2:
How will one use the results from the proposed work in order to improve
the modeling of contact line dynamics at the micron sized scales?


(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is qualified to carry out 
the proposed project.

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The objectives and work program are ok, except that I could not find
how one can use the proposed research to bridge scales from the
nano-scale to micron sized scales.  Also, the priority program description
included phenomena such as contact line dynamics on a bed of flexible
hairs, but are conventional thin-film/long wavelength models
appropriate for such a problem?

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

It is proposed to improve the long wave approximation for modeling
contact line hysterisis and including the effects of surfactant 
transport.  These topics address the aims of the priority program.  
I could not find in the proposal a sufficient description of 
new developments that would address the cases in which 
the assumptions of the long wave/thin film approximations were
not met.

Also I could not find in the proposal a sufficient
description of new developments for the interaction of a flexible 
substrate with a deforming (sliding) drop.

(v) recommendation: Good.

As the applicant says, ``In this project we aim at developing and 
employing a set of generic mesoscopic continuum models
for the (de)wetting dynamics of liquids on substrates with 
adaptive topography and wettability.'' The strategy of the applicant
is to use the thin film/long wave approximation in order to 
meet the proposed objectives.  The thin film approximation
is efficient, and has allowed the applicant to carry out
numerical studies that could not otherwise be practically
simulated.  For example, the applicant used the thin film approximation
to efficiently simulate contact line dynamics for an ensemble
of droplets (see [A6]) and in another article, the applicant used
the thin film approximation when performing a thorough parameter
sensitivity study (stability analysis) for a thin film breaking
up into droplets (see [A3]).

The thin film approximation has drawbacks though and the proposer 
acknowledges these drawbacks:
``Often, experiments are performed for material combinations that
result in contact angles that are not small. In contrast, standard
asymptotic thin-film models are only strictly valid at small angles.
Nevertheless, often they show quite good agreement with
experiments/simulations at moderate angles. Within the gradient
dynamics approach, this can sometimes be strongly improved by
employing better approximations for the energy functional
(e.g., `full curvature trick') while keeping the mobilities of
the asymptotic model (see, e.g., [46] and discussion in [A2]).''

The reviewer notes that in previous articles by the applicant
(Hughes, Thiele, Archer, 2015 and Hughes, Thiele, Archer 2017),
it was found that for predicting static contact angle
conditions, up to 90 degrees, the ``mesoscopic'' thin film
model agrees with density functional theory predictions.

I like this proposal, but I would have liked it better if the applicant
had also proposed some kind of novel hybrid method that used the long
wave approximation away from contact lines, and then somehow transitioned
to either a Level Set, SPH, phase field, volume-of-fluid, or 
Lattice Boltzmann at the contact line (taking into account
forces at the atomistic scale - as was done by Mahady et al).  
A comparison between a purely
thin-film approximation and a hybrid
approach would have been interesting.  Also, I am worried about how
realistic modeling the ``polymer brush'' (which is meant to sit on
top of a solid substrate) by way of an order parameter
field $\psi(x,t)$ (WP 1.1) will be.   I would have liked to have also
seen a non-field-based approach proposed 
for modeling the flexible micro pillars.

(ii) qualification of the applicants.  

The applicants' publication record
and quality of articles published are evidence 
that the applicant is qualified to carry out 
the proposed project.

(iii) objectives and work program.  

The objectives and work program is ok, except that I could not find
how one can use the proposed research to bridge scales from the
nano-scale to micron sized scales.  Only briefly, in sections
WP4.2 and section 2.8, does the applicant discuss 
how to match the proposed
``mesoscopic'' approaches with ``macroscopic'' approaches 
developed by other participants in the priority program.

(iv) Scientific Contribution of the project to the main aims of 
priority program.  

For applications in which the 
thin-film hydrodynamic assumptions are met, 
the proposed research directly addresses the mission of the priority 
program ``Dynamic wetting of flexible, adaptive, and switchable 
surfaces.''

(v) recommendation:  very good.
