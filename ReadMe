Gasoline not optimal for direct injection spray intake.

Gasoline + 10 or 30 percent ethanal might be optimal for direct 
 injection spray intake.

Diesel Engines compression ratio ?

certain fuels have more splashing ...

prototype turbulence model: gas phase turbulence model not enough.
  LES homogeneous assumptions not correct at the interface.

  liquid behaves like a wall - cannot use LES.

  one can use hybrid LES + RANS or WALE (Wall adaptive LE method)

  WALE can be used at liquid-gas interface except that
  the deforming liquid can force turbulence.

  Test WALE model for channel flow.

  cylindrical geometry?
  square duct?

  gas + ethanol contact line dynamics at high temperature (engine conditions)
