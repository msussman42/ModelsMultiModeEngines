``There are some concerns regarding the boundary layer flow modeling. 
Both the need to include subcooled boiling assisted boundary layers 
without having to model or track specific voids, and the need to avoid 
small spatial scales near the wall even without bubble formation and 
collapse, may limit the utility of the proposed approach if the speed 
improvements associated with the coarsest levels cannot be achieved 
over a significant portion of the tank domain.''
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is agreed that a practical number of adaptive mesh refinement levels
might still yield a finest resolution level that still necessitates
that sub-scale boundary layer models be used.  Our adaptive
multiphase code already has the following kinds of related
models implemented:

a. ``A ghost cell method for turbulent compressible viscous flows on
adaptive Cartesian grids,'' Hu, Zhao, Liu, Procedia Engineering (2013)
(implementing the ``law-of-the-wall'' model, such as Troshko and Hassan,
``Law of the wall for two-phase turbulent boundary layers,''
Intl. J. Heat and Mass Transfer, 2001, on an ``embedded'' boundary grid).

b. ``Direct numerical simulation of bubble dynamics in subcooled 
and near-saturated convective nucleate boiling,'' Lal, Sato, and Niceno,
Intl. J. Heat and Fluid Flow, 2015.

c. ``A depletable micro-layer model for nucleate pool boiling,''
Sato and Niceno, Journal of Computational Physics, 2015.

d. ``Application of the improved cavitation model to turbulent cavitating
flow in fuel injector nozzle,'' Bicer and Sou, Applied Mathematical
Modelling, 2016.

That being said, we are constantly improving our algorithm, and 
we have recently developed a very efficient 
``super-mesh'' algorithm,

``A moment-of-fluid method for diffusion equations on irregular domains
in multi-material systems,'' Y. Liu, M. Sussman, Y. Lian, M.Y. Hussaini,
Journal of Computational Physics, Available online 23 October 2019,

which will enable us to effortlessly introduce fine ``subscale'' resolution
supermesh elements directly into the thermal/boundary layer regions of 
a block structured rectangular adaptive mesh refinement grid.  Also, we 
have recently migrated from the 2016 BoxLib libraries to the
2019 AMReX libraries (BoxLib and AMReX are developed by the center
of computational science and Engineering, LBNL) which enables us to exploit a
scalable ``particle container'' class for tracking microscopic seed bubbles
at the wall.

``Technology Transition: The proposal lacks technology transition discussion.''

Maybe this is where we discuss our proposed ``Fluent like'' input module?

``Technical Approach: Although the experiments on magnetically 
levitated droplets and the cryogenic helium flow pipe would be 
interesting cases to verify a new type of thermo fluid model, 
they are not representative of the thermal/fluid conditions 
in a large cryofluid tank in microgravity. These experiments 
add significant effort to the work plan but do not serve to 
validate the model for large tanks in microgravity. ''

My intuition tells me that the referees pondered the ``magnetic levitation''
idea for emulating a microgravity environment for a while, but
perhaps realized magnetic levitation might be the most promising
way to emulate weightlessness without
actually being in outer space or using a drop tower or parabolic flight?

It could be also that the referees were wondering whether one can emulate
the phenomenon of ``interior capillary flow'' using the levitation idea?

``interior capillary flow'' is a big deal: NASA ran some experiments on it
on the space station:
https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/space/iss-research/mwa/cfe-2/
NASA has a whole repository "PSI": Physical science informatics system.
